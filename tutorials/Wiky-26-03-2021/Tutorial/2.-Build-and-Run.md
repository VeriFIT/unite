## 1) Build
The adapter can be built using the build.sh or the build.ps1 script. Note that the run_all script has a -b parameter which runs the build script automatically before running the adapter.

## 2) Run
Use the run_all.sh or the run_all.ps1 script. Useful parameters are -b to build the adapter first, and -t which also starts new terminals tailing log files of the adapter. Wait for the startup to finish based on the information printed by the script. The script also prints what configuration is being used (what conf files). When desired, exit the adapter using ctrl+c (not just pressing the X on the terminal! - this would leave other terminal windows hanging around).

If the -t option is used the script will open three new terminal which tail the log files produced by each of the adapter's components (analysis, compilation, triplestore). The analysi and the compilation logs also print what configuration is being used.
